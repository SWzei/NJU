# Photo Structure

Use this folder for all website images that should be served directly by URL.

## Folder layout

```text
public/photos/
├── hero/               # Homepage hero image
├── club/               # Club daily photos (practice, rehearsal, group photos)
├── events/             # Activity photos
└── concerts/           # Concert-related photos
```

## Recommended file names

These names are already used by the frontend photo manifest:

- `club/林泉社徽.jpg` (site icon + top-left logo)
- `hero/home-hero.jpg`
- `club/room-324.jpg`
- `club/room-325.jpg`
- `events/rehearsal.jpg`
- `events/workshop.jpg`
- `concerts/stage.jpg`
- `concerts/group-photo.jpg`

If you replace these files with your own photos, the website will update automatically.

## Image recommendations

- Format: `jpg` or `png`
- Width: at least `1600px` for hero, `1200px` for gallery
- Keep file size under `1.5MB` per image for better loading speed
